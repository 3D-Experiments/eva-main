# Frequently Asked Questions

## How to pronounce EVA?

EVA is named after my wife Ewa (polish Eve) you read it like: `EH-v uh` *(/ˈɛ.va/)* - like in p<b>E</b>t, <b>V</b>ery, <b>U</b>p.

## Can I buy you a beer?

Sure, I'm not much of a drinker though, I also only drink coffee at home. But if you want to support this work of mine you can use the [:fontawesome-brands-paypal: Paypal.me](https://www.paypal.me/pkucmus) link. The money I gather there I spend on parts, filament and stuff I generally need to use when testing EVA.

Sadly, there is no other way to sponsor EVA as platform like Patreon can't be used with the broken polish tax system... (rant redacted)

## What color scheme can be used?

As long as it's not purple it's fine. As everyone knows black color is the strongest but green is the fastest EVA is black/green so we have the benefits of both ;)

## Wouldn't it be better to attach the hotend directly to the extruder?

It depends, better for what? One of the design goals was to have the motor on top of the MGN carriage, as it weights the most. From there we go down to the nozzle tip, having different sized hotends to support there has to be an interface "layer" between the two. Once you'll use it you will likely forget that this ever bothered you - that's how it was for many users since EVA 1.0.

## Why did you did it like that?

I don't remember.

## No, seriously why?

I don't want to talk about it :}

## It's a standard

If a printer is "EVA Compatible" then it's automatically compatible with everything that comes with EVA - hotends, drives, endstops, bed probes.
A printer can lock to a specific EVA version and update when the change is sigificant enough while the users can follow updates at a faster pace.

## Universal Front

EVA allows you to quickly swap a hotend without fiddling with the belts. Only 6-7 easily accessible screws need to be undone to take the hotend of the carriage to change it or for maintenance purposes.

Hotends compatible with universal front are: **V6**, **Mosquito** and **Dragon** (**Copperhead** and others are incoming).

## Drives

EVA supports different extrusion options - [Titan](../drives/titan), [BMG (and BMG-M)](../drives/bmg), [Orbiter](../drives/orbiter) are mounted on the top and are compatible with all available hotends.

## Bed probing

EVA comes with a defined place for 2 point probe mounting. That enables it to handle many probing solutions. **BL-Touch**, **Inductive probes** and **Duet Mini IR probe** (work in progress) are supported "out-of-the-box".

# EVA

!!! warning "Release Candidate"

    EVA 3.0 is in a release candidate state, meaning it might be unstable - consider yourself an erly adopter :)

    It's tested a lot at this point but since there were so many changes done to it it's only fair to say that it's not released as a stable release (even if the act of stabilization will only mean fixing this documentation).

    Please have patience with it and remember that you will likely need longer belts on your V-Core 3 for EVA 3.0 to work on it.

EVA is a 3D printing carriage **platform** revolving around accesibility - the goal is to give the power of choice to the users by enabling as many options for carriage hardware as possible. The "platform" part means a few things, for one EVA is a specification - a 3D printer can be EVA compatible (not the other way around - EVA is not to be compatible with a printer) thus automatically accuiring all the hardware compatibility EVA brings and will bring in it's future versions. New versions appear with compatibility for new hardware. Aside from being a spec, EVA also comes with a set of parts ready to use on compatible printers.

EVA is developed by me - [PaweÅ‚ Kucmus](https://github.com/pkucmus) and the fantastic EVA and Rat Rig community.

## Getting started

Navigate to the [Getting Started](/getting_started) page to learn where to start. If you know your way around this place already and just looking for a download link you will find it below. Either way please read further down to learn about the people behind EVA.

## Updates

Best way to see what is new is to attend the live streams on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkbho7PSaXQlU6l5Vt3wfKA).

## Support and attributions

### Rat Rig

My and EVA's relationship with Rat Rig should not be a suprise as I'm also responsible for V-Core 3, V-Minion and V-Core Pro 1.2 and up. 
Rat Rig was and still is providing me with an amazing support in terms of hardware, guidance and emotional support :smile:

All of their printers are EVA compatible.

### Other companies

The nature of EVA is specific in a way that I always did shy away from any free parts producers were willing to send me. If I got something for free it was immedietly sent to one of the beta testers. This is to prevent accusations towards the platform for being biased. 

**There is no way of purchasing a spot here.**

That said if this will change and I'll start receiving parts it will not be a secret and I'll probably list those on one of the release lives on YouTube.

### People

**Mikkel Schmidt** and **Marc Marschall** constantly pushed for more improvements, took some of the work of my shoulders - big thank you. **Simon Davie** is helping out for as long as I can remember, printer compatibility would not ba as good if not for Simon's checks. 

There's also a big group of people that helped out with beta testing, they had to go through a lot of work and plastic to test all the different iterations that I was producing when fixing more and more bugs - amazing bunch of people.

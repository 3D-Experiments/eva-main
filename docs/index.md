# EVA 2

TBD... Video explaining how to navigate

!!! question "Not what you are looking for?"

    EVA is split into multiple repositories to make it more managable - think about it like remixes on Thingiverse.

    You can find everything that's related to EVA here: [:octicons-mark-github-16: EVA-3D](https://github.com/EVA-3D)

## Platform

EVA is a carriage platform for MGN rail based printers. The main goal is to support what people may have laying around or have easy access to. EVA is trying to implement that goal.

The specification is described in a separate
[:octicons-mark-github-16: EVA 2 / Spec]({{urls.spec}}) document.

## Download

The whole package can be downloaded as a ZIP package, otherwise you can navigate to the [:octicons-mark-github-16: `stls` directory]({{config.repo_url}}/stls).

[Download :octicons-download-24:]({{download_zip}}){: .md-button .md-button--primary }

In short, **yes**. One can use EVA 2 on a MGN15C carriage.

While EVA 2 does not natively support MGN15 (it was dropped in 2.0.0), "native support" at this point means only that it's not a part of this main repository.

The **top** and **bottom** parts required to mount an EVA 2 on a MGN15 carriage can be found here: {{ eva_link("mgn15") }}

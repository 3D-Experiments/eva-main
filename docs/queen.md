# Queen Shroud

![](/assets/queens.png)

I wanted to do something as a thank you for those who donate to the EVA project. I can't as Polish tax system is *(redacted rambling)*... Long story short I can't do more for a donation than say: "Thank you".

The result of that is that I'm releasing the Queen shroud for everyone to use like the rest of the parts, please enjoy.

If you want to help me buy filament, parts, flowers for my wife (:laughing:) or just buy me a coffee please use this link: [:fontawesome-brands-paypal: Paypal.me](https://www.paypal.me/pkucmus)

Thank you! :wink:

Use the navigation on the left (or in the top left menu on small screens) to navigate through the **heat insert** parts. Those are recommended for parts printed with ASA and ABS.

The insert size EVA is modeled for is **M3 x D4.6 x L4.0** but this does not have to be exact, i.e. D5.0 or L5.0 inserts should work as well, just might require a bit of clean up of the plastic that's pushed out.

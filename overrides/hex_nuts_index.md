Use the navigation on the left (or in the top left menu on small screens) to navigate through the **hex nuts** parts. Those are easier to assemble if you don't have experience with heat inserts, hex nuts are also cheaper and easier to come by.

Then inserting the nuts into their sockets you should use the "backpull" method. Thread a screw through the hole, add a nut on the screw and pull the nut in by screwing it in. This will ensure your nut is aligned correctly - failing to to so carries the risk of a screw binding in a nut mid-assembly rendering your build trash.

Hex nuts also require plenty of sacrificial layers, those are simple to remove, poke them out with a screwdriver or drill out.
